# FAIG-LABS
Experimental Code that may or not make it's way into FAIG

New ways of doing things, I am trawling github for new ways of looking at the Forex trading problem. 
I have created some random scripts to do with IG and Forex and maybe shares too. 

Enjoy, But you should always look at FAIG for the most stable.
